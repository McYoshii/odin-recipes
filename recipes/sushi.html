			<h2>Steps</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Rinse the sushi rice several times until the water runs clear. Drain the rice in a colander for 30 minutes.</li>
				<li>Combine the rice and water in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, covered, for 15-20 minutes, or until the water is absorbed and the rice is tender.</li>
				<li>Remove the rice from the heat and let it sit, covered, for 10 minutes.</li>
				<li>Combine the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small saucepan and heat until the sugar dissolves.</li>
				<li>Add the vinegar mixture to the rice and stir to combine.</li>
				<li>Place a sheet of nori on a sushi mat or a piece of plastic wrap. Spread a thin layer of rice over the nori, leaving a 1-inch border at the top edge.</li>
				<li>Arrange the fillings in a line across the center of the rice. Use the sushi mat or plastic wrap to roll the sushi into a tight cylinder, tucking in the fillings as you go.</li>
				<li>Use a sharp knife to slice the sushi roll into rounds.</li>
				<li>Serve the sushi with soy sauce, wasabi paste, and pickled ginger.</li>
